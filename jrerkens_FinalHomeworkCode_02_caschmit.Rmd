![Cute Sleepy Coppery Titi Monkey](https://png.pngtree.com/thumb_back/fw800/background/20221023/pngtree-an-exotic-primate-species-from-south-america-a-closeup-of-a-sleeping-coppery-titia-tropical-red-monkey-photo-image_28510004.jpg)

**You just reminded me I forgot to add a Titi Monkey photo! That is a very cute sleepy titi. -AJL**

>NOTE: Soooo this is a red howler monkey (*Alouatta seniculus*), not a titi monkey (which are the genera *Plecturocebus*, *Cheracebus*, and *Callicebus*)!  Please take AN/BI 336 when I next teach it, we'll go over this!

# Libraries

Load in the necessary libraries:

```{r}
library(prettydoc)
library(yaml)
library(tidyverse)
library(tinytex) # install.packages("tinytex") <3
```

**Very kind and forward-thinking of you to provide the packages, thank you! -AJL**

>Agreed - this is best practices for setting up a readable and reproducible Rmarkdown file.

# Questions

## Initializations
**I like the nested toc structure. -AJL**
The number of titi monkey calls in a 2 hour window is represented by X. X ~ Pois($\lambda$ = 15)

## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

We can use `ppois()` to find out cumulative probabilities!

```{r}
ppois(q = 8, lambda = 15, lower.tail = F) # NOTE lower.tail = F does not include 8, so we must start at 7
# Double note!
```

The probability we hear 8 or more calls is 0.963.
**We got the same answer but I used 1-ppois instead of changing the lower tail, maybe that helps you? -AJL**

>Yeah, we get the same answer with 1-ppois, but only if using q = 8. I do think you can use q = 8 with ppois and get to this answer... can you show me the documentation that suggests we'd need to use q = 7? Seems odd to me.

## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

Again, we can use `ppois()` to find out cumulative probabilities!

```{r}
ppois(q = 0, lambda = 15, lower.tail = T) # 0 or less calls in a session
```

The probability we hear 0 calls is 3.059 x 10^-7.

>This works because ppois is accumulating from 0 to 0, yes. I might recommend dpois as a better choice since this is actually requesting a point value.

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

We can use `dpois()` to find the probability at exactly X = 3!

```{r}
dpois(x = 3, lambda = 15) # why do we use dpois()
```

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

```{r}
x <- seq(from = 1, to = 30, by = 1) # sequence from 1:30, we're gonna do dpois on each of these values
plot(dpois(x, lambda = 15), xlab = # plot
"Number of titi monkey calls in a 2 hour period", # labels
ylab = "Probability")
title(main = "Theoretical true distribution of titi monkey calls") # title
```

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

We're going to use `rpois()` to make this work. We use `rpois()` to (pseudo)randomly generate n many values from a user-defined poisson distribution.

```{r}
set.seed(812) # setting a seed, it's my birthday aww how cute
simulated_titi <- rpois(n = 104, lambda = 15) # we're gonna generate 104 values from a poisson(15)
head(simulated_titi, 10)
```


## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}
hist(simulated_titi, xlim = range(0:30), breaks = 0:30, col = "steelblue", 
xlab = "Number of titi calls in a 2 hour period",
main = "Simulated data of 104 poisson generated titi calls")
```

It looks somewhat similar to the theoretical model. However, because this is simulated data, it isn't a perfect match! There are less values at x = 14 than we would expect, for example, and it seems there are a couple outliers.

>Nice color choice!

# Challenges I faced

1. I struggled with my `YAML` because I forgot to put "output:" in my header. I ended up copying and pasting a header I made at an earlier date, and realized my mistake.\ **MY yaml also got me the first few times, I couldn't get the theme to work at first. -AJL**
\

>Yes... ALWAYS copy/paste for the first go at something. Modification can come later.

2. I was struggling with adding the `cayman` theme to my document. I knit my document a few times and was failing to compile. I eventually pulled up an old stat homework and found the `prettydoc::pretty_html:` syntax.\ **Yes, this is the problem I was just referencing, I found this through googling. Try putting it where the html document is now instead of at the end and then put theme: cayman in a separate line because the theme still isn't showing up in the knit for me. -AJL**
\

>Glad you figured it out!  Google is your best friend when coding.

3. I forgot the exact markdown syntax for inserting an image, so I looked it up and figured it out.\
\
4. I needed to check how `lower.tail` functioned to ensure that I was including 8 calls (i.e., is this equal to or greater or just greater). I had to adjust my code because I initally had q = 8; I changed q = 7. \
\

>Again... not sure this is correct. Would love to see the documentation.

5. I forgot `hist()` and `plot()` had different arguments within the function. I had to take `xlab()` etc. and place within `hist()` argument.

>Overall this looks good! You're clearly thinking through and looking up documentation to assess how to move forward, which is great. Aside from the misidentified monkey (never trust a colloquial species assignment... this is one case where google needs serious double-checking), this all is great. Also, I know I mentioned I only want to see the 6 homework-related files in the repo, but for ease of use I strongly recommend creating a project in which to house these files! Not sure if you erased it to be compliant, but it's definitely something you should be doing.
